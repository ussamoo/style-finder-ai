        - **[Food Item]**: [Portion Size], [Number of Calories] calories

        Example:
        *   **Salmon**: 6 ounces, 210 calories

        Example:
        Total Calories: [Number of Calories]

        Example:
        *   **Protein**: Salmon (35g), Asparagus (3g), Tomatoes (1g) = [Total Protein]

        5. **Health Evaluation**: Evaluate the healthiness of the meal in one paragraph.
